I am a final-year Civil Engineering student at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I am preparing to apply for a PhD in the United States (Fall 2026).

My academic interests include sustainable infrastructure, urban hydrology, resilient construction systems, and environmentally responsible urban development. I have been actively involved in research, leadership, community service, and national-level competitions.

My journey from socio-economic hardship to academic excellence has been recognized through multiple national scholarships, awards, and media coverage.
